# CODE COMMUNITY PROJECT (PART ONE)

## ISSUE: [Correct README.md layout](https://github.com/devncode/first-contributions/issues/237)

### What is README.md?

It's a text file that accompanies a software project, written in Markdown format to add formatting and structure using simple syntax.

### Why is a README.md important?

It's the first point of contact for anyone encountering your project, providing essential information about its purpose, usage, and more. A well-written README.md enhances accessibility, collaboration, and potential user engagement.
